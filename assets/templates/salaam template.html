Assalamo Alaykum: Spreading Peace, Love, and Divine Blessing

(Khutbat al-Haajjah)
Innal-hamdalillahi nahmaduhu wa nasta’eenuhu wa nastaghfiruhu wa na’oodhu billahi min shuroori anfusinaa wa min sayyi’ati a‘maalinaa. May-yahdihillahu falaa mudilla lahu wa may-yudlilhu falaa haadiya lahu. Wa ash-hadu an laa ilaaha illallah, wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasooluhu.
Praise be to Allah; we praise Him, seek His help, and ask His forgiveness. We seek refuge with Allah from the evil of our own souls and from our bad deeds. Whoever Allah guides, none can misguide; and whoever He lets go astray, none can guide. I bear witness that there is no one worthy of worship except Allah alone, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.  May Allah send peace and blessings on him and his family and his companions and his followers.

O you who believe, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims. O you who believe, fear Allah and speak a word that is right. He will amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has achieved a great triumph.

Introduction: The Timeless Sunnah of Salaam
Assalamo alaykum. 
Dear Brothers and sisters, we live in a world hungry for connection, troubled by division, and yearning for inner and social peace. Yet, Allah ﷻ has given this Ummah a key to healing and unity—a practice that is simple, profound, and transformative: the greeting of Assalamo alaykum. This greeting is not just a phrase uttered out of habit; it is a strand of the spiritual DNA of Islam, a direct link to paradise, and a powerful, daily Sunnah of our beloved Prophet ﷺ.
Despite its beauty and importance, many of us hesitate to offer salaam, especially to those we do not know. Sometimes it feels awkward, or we find ourselves waiting for the other person to initiate. Today, let us rediscover the wisdom, depth, and rewards of spreading salaam, address the root of our hesitations, and commit to living the message of peace that is written for us by Allah and His Messenger ﷺ.

The Quranic Emphasis on Salaam
 Allah ﷻ has given us the key to salaam, and it is not just a greeting; it is a command, a supplication, and a sign of faith.

Allah ﷻ says:
"And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it or (at least) return it equally. Certainly, Allah is Ever a Careful Account Taker of all things."
(Qur’an 4:86) 

In this verse, Allah commands us not only to return greetings but to do so with excellence. This behavior is not a small thing; it is rewarded by Allah, the Perfect. The Prophet ﷺ explained this further, teaching us that the one who initiates the greeting is "closest to Allah and best in manners".
The Quran also refers to the people of paradise and those on the straight path as practitioners and recipients of salaam:
"Their greeting the Day they meet Him will be, 'Peace (Salaam).' And He has prepared for them a noble reward."
(Qur’an 33:44)

"And Allah invites to the Home of Peace (Dar al-Salaam) and guides whom He wills to a straight path."
(Qur’an 10:25)

This imagery indicates that salaam is not just the etiquette of this world but the eternal language of paradise, a reflection of the inner state of the people whom Allah has favored.
Even the greeting between the Prophets and their communities in the Quran is often marked by the word "Salaam"—indicative of a tradition that connects us to the best of creation and the highest ideals. For example:
"Peace be upon Abraham." (Qur’an 37:109)
"Peace be upon Moses and Aaron." (Qur’an 37:120)

And Allah explicitly commands:
"O you who have believed, do not enter houses other than your own houses until you ascertain welcome and greet their inhabitants; that is best for you, perhaps you will be reminded."
(Qur’an 24:27)

Thus, salaam is a Quranic prescription for all social relations, both at home and in wider society.

<bold> The Story of Adam and the Origin of Salaam </bold>

Let us journey back to our beginning. In a powerful hadith, our Prophet ﷺ narrated the very first moment of human interaction:
“When Allah created Adam, He breathed the soul into him, then he sneezed and said: ‘All praise is due to Allah.’ His Lord said to him: ‘May Allah have mercy upon you, O Adam. Go to those angels—a gathering of them—and say, "As-Salamu alaikum." They replied, "Wa Alaika as-Salamu wa Rahmatullah." Then He said: ‘This is your greeting and the greeting of your children among each other.’”
(Jami‘ at-Tirmidhi 3367, also in Sahih Bukhari and Muslim)

Imagine this: the very first exchange in human history between Adam عليه السلام and the angels was an exchange of salaam. It was instituted by Allah as the greeting of all the children of Adam—a direct divine command and a Sunnah for all humankind.


The Command to Greet Known and Unknown

Many of us restrict the greeting of salaam to those we are familiar with—family, friends, trusted companions. But Islam came to break the barriers of arrogance, pride, and division. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked:
“‘Which deed in Islam is the best?’ He said: ‘Feeding people and greeting those you know and those you do not know.’”
(Sahih Bukhari and Muslim)

This concise Hadith is a revolutionary social teaching. By instructing us to offer salaam both to those we know and those we do not, the Prophet ﷺ was mapping out a path for breaking cycles of alienation, loneliness, suspicion, and hostility. Scholar after scholar—classical and contemporary—have commented that this is the foundation of a unified, compassionate Ummah.

Scholars explain how the Prophet’s practice of greeting even children, the elderly, strangers—even those of different faiths—encouraged the community to see one another as bearers of the same dua for peace and protection. This culture was meant to create mutual respect and dissolve the “cliques” or in-groups that plague many communities today.

 The act of greeting with salaam becomes a form of social resistance—an expression that, at its core, stands for trust, inclusion, humility, and the erasure of artificial boundaries.

“Do not single out anyone out of arrogance or to impress them, but do it to honor the symbols of Islam and to foster Islamic brotherhood.”

Initiating Salaam: Overcoming Hesitation and Awkwardness

Psychological Barriers and the Sunnah of Taking the First Step
Let us reflect: Why do many of us hesitate to initiate salaam? Often, it is a sense of shyness, fear of rejection, or a mistaken belief that the "other" should greet us first due to status, age, or simply habit.
Islam decisively corrects this thinking. The Prophet ﷺ said:
“The person nearest to Allah is one who is the first to offer greeting.”
(Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi: Sahih)

“He who starts the greeting is the one who is best in manners and closest to Allah.”
(Sahih Muslim)

 

Thre is great reward for saying the Salaam. So do not expect that it will be easy every time. 
1. rises above the ego, 
2. conquers his or her shyness,  
3. takes the first step toward connection.

This is not about prestige, but about humility, good character, and spiritual proximity to Allah.


Insights from the Scholars

A scholar reminded us that our sins are forgiven and our ranks elevated. When you say ‘Assalamo alaykum,’ you are literally making dua for the safety, security, and mercy of the person you greet. Do not underestimate this act because it is one of the hallmark features of our faith. The hesitation to greet first is often a sign of pride or indifference, whereas the one who initiates is actively earning Allah's favor.”

So many times I hesitated to give Salaam, and then realized how salaam offered even in uncertainty (like when you don’t know if someone is Muslim) can transform awkward encounters into moments of connection, eliminating the culture of suspicion. He recounts how in his community, those who routinely offered salaam—even to strangers—transformed their neighborhoods into havens of trust and familiarity. He emphasizes that Allah’s command in Surah An-Nisa to answer greetings with something better is a principle for both individual etiquette and community harmony.
Kamal Makki—In his Jummah khutbahs and workshops, Kamal Makki encourages the youth to break out of their comfort zones, practicing salaam as a means of dawah—even greeting Muslims who may look or dress differently. By initiating the greeting, he explains, you model the Prophetic practice and inspire others to do the same, creating a ripple effect in the community.
Yasir Fazaga—Imam Fazaga, experienced in both scholarly and counseling fields, shares that salaam is one of the easiest tools for social healing, particularly in communities fractured by differences or past disagreements. He relates how during challenging times, initiating salaam can melt away animosities and open doors to reconciliation.

The Deeper Spiritual Meanings of Salaam
Salaam: Safety, Peace, Wholeness, and Divine Protection
The word salaam comes from the Arabic root S-L-M, which signifies not just the absence of war but wholeness, safety, tranquility, reconciliation, and divine protection. It is closely related to Allah's Beautiful Name, "As-Salaam"—The Source of Peace.
To say "Assalamo alaykum" is, therefore, not a mundane “hello”—it is an invocation that the recipient be safe from all harm, at peace in this life and the next, and under the protection of the Almighty.
Nouman Ali Khan explains that the greeting is a supplication, not merely an expression. It is as if you are praying: “May you be freed from all the things that disturb your heart, mind, or soul. May you be protected by Allah from every evil seen and unseen.”
Yasir Qadhi, elaborating from classical sources, points out how the salaam is completely unique in religious traditions. Unlike a wish or a generic well-wishing, each syllable of the greeting invokes both peace and mercy as a living force in the recipient’s life. When multiplied in a community, the greeting becomes a powerful social engine for fostering safety, love, and tranquility.
Linguistic Analysis:
- Salaam = Peace, safety, wholeness
- Saleem = Sound, safe, intact
- Salim = One who is saved
- Islam = Submission (rooted in same triliteral root)
- Muslim = One who submits (and is thus safe or saves others from harm)
Thus, the greeting encompasses not only a prayer for worldly safety, but also for a state of spiritual wholeness and for protection in the Hereafter.

Hadiths: Spreading Salaam Leads to Love and Paradise
No teaching of our Prophet ﷺ on the salaam is more profound and motivational than the well-known hadith:
"You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not guide you to something which, if you do, you will love one another? Spread Salaam among yourselves."
(Sahih Muslim)

With this statement, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ makes a direct, inseparable link between paradise, faith, love, and the practical action of spreading salaam. This chain includes three crucial steps:
- Belief is necessary for Paradise.
- Love is necessary for belief to be perfected.
- Spreading salaam is the means by which love is created.
This is not just a motivational anecdote—it is the spiritual logic of Islam’s approach to community and brotherhood. Yasir Qadhi, in the Ramadan Series, unpacks this by highlighting that when the greeting is offered consistently, barriers of jealousy, prejudice, and suspicion dissolve, and what remains is authentic bond and mutual love—the exact opposite of what Satan wants for us.
Further, in another narration, the Prophet ﷺ instructed:
“Spread peace among yourselves, feed the hungry, maintain kinship ties, pray at night when others sleep, and you will enter Paradise in peace.”
(Sunan Ibn Majah 3251)

MuslimCentral and its featured speakers repeatedly remind us that this “cascade of virtues”—beginning with salam—results not just in social benefit but in the highest spiritual reward.

|  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | 


As reflected in the Sunnah, each increase of the greeting brings an increase in reward, demonstrating that salaam is one of the easiest ways to amass rewards and mercy.

Salaam in the Life of the Prophet ﷺ
When we say salaam to one another, we are stepping into the literal footsteps of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. He never withheld salaam. Whether addressing companions, children, women, the elderly, or strangers—even enemies who later embraced Islam—he always initiated, and he always responded in kind or better.
Kamal Makki recounts in his youth halaqas how the Prophet ﷺ would sometimes go out of his way in the marketplaces of Madinah, greeting all whom he came across without discrimination. Similarly, companions such as Abdullah bin Umar would regularly walk through the market greeting each person—not to buy or sell, but simply to fulfill the Sunnah of making peace a living reality.
In the Prophet’s Farewell Sermon, he extolled acts that knit individuals into a brotherly community, beginning again with the instruction to spread salaam.

Today’s scholars, including Yasir Fazaga and Nouman Ali Khan, warn us against making the greeting a mere ritual or formality. It was never meant to be the "password of the club" but the open hand of faith to humanity.

Insights from MuslimCentral and Contemporary Scholars
Scholars remind us that salaam is more than words—it is the antidote to loneliness, arrogance, and alienation.
- "no other religious tradition has a daily greeting prescribed directly by revelation, a greeting that is not just a good wish, but a prayer for actual divine protection."
- where awkwardness and suspicion have increased, salaam is a “social contract” that can cut through walls and suspicion—provided we revive its true spirit.
-  small acts of initiating salaam create “ripple effects” where once a critical mass is built, a culture of belonging and unity is established, even among youth.
- it transforms effect of salaam upon those marginalized, estranged, or hurt—restoring hope and community by the power of a simple greeting.
MuslimCentral’s repository houses dozens of khutbahs, podcasts, and articles emphasizing these themes and offering practical strategies for breaking the awkwardness barrier in a Western context.

Overcoming Awkwardness and Social Barriers: Engaging Delivery Techniques
Addressing Hesitation: Understanding and Action
- Acknowledge the awkwardness: It is normal in many cultures, especially where Muslims are a minority, to feel awkward about greeting strangers—even those who look Muslim. Admit that this hesitation exists; you are not alone.
- Recall Allah’s command and the Sunnah: Remember that initiating salaam is not a cultural gesture: it is a spiritual act with monumental reward.
- Visualize the reward: Picture yourself being “nearest to Allah,” as the Prophet ﷺ described the one who offers salaam first.
- Practice in safe spaces: Start among family, then friends, then extend to mosque and public settings. Each step breaks the hesitation cycle and solidifies your confidence.
- Smile sincerely: The Prophet said, “Do not scorn any good deed, even meeting your brother with a cheerful face.” A warm salaam, even to one who seems reluctant, plants the seeds of trust and love.
Delivery tips taken from khutbah guides and experienced khateebs:
- Use relatable, local examples or stories of how initiating salaam changed someone's day or led to reconciliation.
- Pose questions: “Imagine if every person in this masjid made it their goal to greet three new faces with salaam today?”
- Encourage a challenge: “This week, try greeting a Muslim stranger, or someone with whom you’ve had friction, and reflect on the result.”
The goal is to transform theory into community action, helping salaam become the pulse of your center or mosque.

The Home of Peace: Dar al-Salaam
The ultimate destiny for believers is the abode called "Dar al-Salaam" (The Home of Peace). Allah says:
"And Allah invites to the Home of Peace and guides whom He wills to a straight path."
(Qur’an 10:25)

Shaykh Yusuf Weltch and other classical exegetes remind us that “Dar al-Salaam” refers to paradise itself. Thus, every time we give or receive salaam, we are rehearsing our entry into the eternal home—a daily reminder that our ultimate hope is complete peace, security, and welcome from our Lord.

Responding to Salaam: A Divine Obligation
It is not enough to merely offer salaam; responding is a divine command. Allah says:
“When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it or (at least) return it equally.”
(Qur’an 4:86)

The scholars explain that this command removes excuses for arrogance or neglect. Treat each salaam as a trust—one that, if broken, leaves a gap in the community’s spiritual wall.
Even if you are busy, tired, or unresponsive, return salaam clearly and with identical or increased blessing. Classical scholars considered deliberately withholding salaam—or refusing to respond—a sign of spiritual weakness or even sin in certain contexts.

Dissolving Divisions: Salaam as a Weapon against Arrogance, Clannishness, and Neglect
When the Prophet ﷺ migrated to Madinah, he emphasized four things that would define the new Muslim society:
“Spread salaam, feed the hungry, keep strong family ties, and pray at night when others sleep, and you will enter paradise in peace.”
(Sunan Ibn Majah 3251)

Most significant is the order of actions: salaam first—before charity, before even familial ties. It is the foundation of brotherhood and social mercy.
Kamal Makki and Yasir Fazaga both remind us that salaam is the air a healthy community breathes. Withholding it, or restricting it to “people like us,” suffocates the room and robs us of our Prophetic inheritance. The youth, new Muslims, and marginalized may feel estranged from the masjid because no one ever offered them the Prophetic greeting.

Final Reflections: Salaam as a Daily Revival of Faith
Concluding the Khutbah
1. Start with intention.  Oh Allah, I am going to give Salaam because it is pleasing to you.

2. My reward is from Allah.

3. Beautiful dua that you are not going to harm him with your tongue.  you are safe from me.

4.  Even if he does not reply.  This is your chance to think good about people.  <italic>Maybe he did not hear me. Maybe he has a hearing problem. Maybe he did not understand me. Maybe he was too suprised to reply.</italic>

The Prophet ﷺ said, “Do not scorn any good deed, even meeting your brother with a cheerful face.” A warm salaam, even to one who seems reluctant, plants the seeds of trust and love.

Brothers and sisters, greeting with, responding to, and spreading salaam is an opportunity that tracks every relationship in our lives—family, friends, community, even those we have yet to meet.

If there is one Sunnah you can revive today that will bring you closer to Allah, sweep away your sins, open doors to new relationships, heal old wounds, and prepare you for paradise, it is the Sunnah of spreading salaam.


Let us break the chain of shyness and hesitation—not for pride, not for ritual, but for Allah and His Messenger ﷺ. 

Let us be humble enough to greet those who may turn away, generous enough to greet those we do not know, and bold enough to initiate salaam whenever the opportunity arises.

A simple Assalamo alaykum—spoken with sincerity—is a shield, a prayer, and a bridge to the eternal Dar al-Salaam.

Call to Action: The Weekly Challenge
Starting from today, make a pledge:

- Initiate salaam to at least three people you do not know each week.
- Teach children and youth this Sunnah, explaining its reward, not just its words.
- If you feel shy or awkward, remember this is shaitan’s trick to keep you from a Sunnah directly linked to paradise.
Let every one of us be “the nearest to Allah” at every gathering, every prayer, and every time we meet a fellow Muslim.
