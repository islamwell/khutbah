**الحمد لله رب العالمين، والصلاة والسلام على أشرف الأنبياء والمرسلين**

All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds. Peace and blessings be upon the most noble of prophets and messengers, Muhammad ﷺ.

Dear brothers and sisters, **As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.**

## The Central Message

Today, I want to speak to you about one simple but powerful truth: **The Quran is a Living Book for Living People.**

Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says in Surah Ta-Ha:

**وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِى فَإِنَّ لَهُۥ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا وَنَحْشُرُهُۥ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَعْمَىٰ**

*"But whoever turns away from My remembrance will have a difficult life, and We will raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection."* **(Surah Ta-Ha, 20:124)**

This is not a threat, brothers and sisters. This is a warning from the Most Merciful. This is guidance from the One who created us and knows what is best for us.

---

## Part One: The Promise of Allah

Just before this verse, Allah tells us:

**فَمَنِ اتَّبَعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا يَضِلُّ وَلَا يَشْقَىٰ**

*"Then whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray nor fall into misery."* **(Surah Ta-Ha, 20:123)**

Look at this beautiful promise! Allah is saying: **Follow My guidance, and you will never be lost. Follow My guidance, and you will never be miserable.**

But what happens when we turn away? When we put the Quran on the shelf? When we only open it during Ramadan? When we treat it like a book for the dead instead of a Living Book for Living People?

Allah tells us clearly: **معيشة ضنكا** - *a difficult life, a narrow life, a life of hardship.*

---

## Part Two: Understanding the Hardship

Brothers and sisters, let me ask you something. Why do we see so much anxiety today? So much depression? So much stress? So many people have everything - money, homes, cars, success - but they are not happy. Why?

Because **you harvest what you plant.**

If you plant distance from Allah, you will harvest difficulty in your heart. If you plant forgetfulness of the Quran, you will harvest confusion in your life.

Allah is teaching us a simple law of life: **Tit for tat.** You get what you give.

The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said:

**"العجب للمؤمن إن أمره كله خير"**

*"Amazing is the affair of the believer! His entire affair is good. When something good happens to him, he thanks Allah, and that is good for him. When something bad happens to him, he is patient, and that is good for him."* **(Sahih Muslim)**

---

## Part Three: The Believer's Wonderful Situation

Do you see the beauty in this? **The believer's situation is wonderful!**

When good comes to him, he does not become arrogant. He does not forget who gave him that good. He says **الحمد لله** - *Alhamdulillah* - and his status rises with Allah.

When hardship comes to him, he does not complain and curse his situation. He says **إنا لله وإنا إليه راجعون** - *"Truly, to Allah we belong and to Him we shall return"* - and his sins are forgiven.

Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala sometimes wants to raise a person's status, but their good deeds are not enough. So what does Allah do? He tests them with trials. And when that person is patient, their sins are wiped away, and their rank is elevated.

This is the mercy of Allah! Even our difficulties are gifts when we remember Him!

---

## Part Four: The Danger of Turning Away

But what about the one who turns away from the remembrance of Allah? What about the one who throws the Book of Allah behind their back?

Allah gives us a powerful example in the Quran. He speaks about those who were given knowledge but abandoned it. He compares them to **a donkey carrying books.**

Imagine a donkey with heavy books on its back. The donkey carries them, but it does not benefit from them. It just wants to throw the load off its back. It gets no guidance, no light, no wisdom from those books.

Brothers and sisters, are we like that donkey? Do we carry the Quran on our shelves, in our homes, but never let it enter our hearts? Do we want to throw off the "burden" of following Allah's commands?

**This is disgrace!** When we throw the Book of Allah behind our backs, disgrace comes upon us in this life and the next.

---

## Part Five: The Consequences

The Prophet ﷺ warned us. He said:

**"لو تعلمون ما أعلم لضحكتم قليلا ولبكيتم كثيرا"**

*"If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much."* 

And he ﷺ said about the punishment of the grave:

**"You would stop burying your dead if you could see the punishment of the grave."**

Brothers and sisters, this is serious! When we turn away from Allah's remembrance:

1. **In this life:** We live with anxiety, stress, and hardship - even if we have wealth
2. **In the grave:** There is punishment for those who forgot Allah
3. **On the Day of Judgment:** Allah will raise us up **blind**

Can you imagine? Being raised on the Day of Judgment, unable to see? The person will cry out:

**"My Lord! Why have You raised me blind when I used to see?"**

And Allah will respond:

**"Just as Our signs came to you and you forgot them, so today you will be forgotten."**

## Part Six: The Solution is Simple

Dear brothers and sisters, I am not here to frighten you. I am here to wake us up! To remind us! Because the solution is so simple, so beautiful, so within our reach!

Allah says:

**فَمَنِ اتَّبَعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا يَضِلُّ وَلَا يَشْقَىٰ**

*"Whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray nor fall into misery."*

**That's it!** Follow the guidance of Allah, and you will be saved from confusion and misery!

Make the Quran a **Living Book** in your life! Not a book on the shelf. Not a book only for funerals. But a book you read, understand, and live by every single day!

---

## Part Seven: Practical Steps

Let me give you simple steps we can all take:

### 1. **Daily Connection with the Quran**
Read even one page a day. Just one page! If you read one page every day, you will finish the entire Quran in one year. And if you cannot read Arabic, read the translation. Allah wants you to understand His message!

### 2. **Make This Beautiful Dua**
The Prophet ﷺ taught us to say:

**"اللهم إني أعوذ بك من عذاب القبر"**

*"O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the grave."*

Say this dua in your prayers. Teach it to your children. Protect yourself and your family!

### 3. **Command Good and Forbid Evil**
The Prophet ﷺ said:

**"You must enjoin good and forbid evil, or else Allah will send punishment upon you, and you will make dua but it will not be accepted."** **(Tirmidhi)**

Brothers and sisters, when we see wrong, we cannot stay silent! When we see injustice, we must speak! When we see people leaving the path of Allah, we must remind them with wisdom and kindness!

### 4. **Be Grateful in Good Times**
When Allah blesses you, say **Alhamdulillah.** Do not become arrogant. Do not think you did it all by yourself. Remember who gave you that blessing!

### 5. **Be Patient in Hard Times**
When trials come - and they will come - be patient. Say **إنا لله وإنا إليه راجعون.** Remember that Allah is testing you to raise your status and forgive your sins!

## Part Eight: The State of Our Ummah

Brothers and sisters, look at the state of our world today. Look at how economies are struggling. Look at how people are anxious and confused about basic truths.

Why? Because we have collectively turned away from Allah's guidance!

When societies accept **riba (interest)**, when they agree upon things that Allah has forbidden, when they throw the Book of Allah behind their backs - what do they expect?

Allah's law is clear: **You harvest what you plant.**

If we plant disobedience, we will harvest hardship. If we plant forgetfulness of Allah - **framoshi** of the Quran - we will harvest misery.

But if we return to Allah, if we make the Quran living in our lives, if we follow His guidance - He promises us:

**فَلَا يَضِلُّ وَلَا يَشْقَىٰ**

*"You will neither go astray nor fall into misery."*

---

## Part Nine: A Call to Action

My dear brothers and sisters, today is Friday. **Yawm al-Jumu'ah** - the best day of the week. This is a day of new beginnings.

Let today be the day you decide: **I will not be like the donkey carrying books but not benefiting from them!**

Let today be the day you decide: **The Quran will be a Living Book in my life!**

Let today be the day you decide: **I will remember Allah, and I will not turn away from His remembrance!**

Start small. Make one change. Read one page. Make one dua. Apply one teaching. But start today!

Because every moment we delay, we are moving further from the guidance that will save us in this life and the next.

## Closing

Brothers and sisters, I leave you with this final thought:

The choice is ours. Allah has given us free will. He has sent us the Quran. He has shown us the path.

Will we follow it and find peace, guidance, and success?

Or will we turn away and suffer the consequences in this life and the next?

The answer is in your hands. The answer is in your heart. The answer is in your daily choices.

**May Allah make us among those who follow His guidance.**

**May Allah protect us from the punishment of the grave.**

**May Allah raise us up on the Day of Judgment with light on our faces, the Quran in our hearts, and success in our books.**

**May Allah make the Quran a Living Book in our lives, not just words on a page.**

**آمين يا رب العالمين**

---

**أقول قولي هذا وأستغفر الله لي ولكم**

*I say these words and I seek forgiveness from Allah for me and for you.*

**وصلى الله على نبينا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين**

*And may Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and all his companions.*

---

**الحمد لله رب العالمين**
